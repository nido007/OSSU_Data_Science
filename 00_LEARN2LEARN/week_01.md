### Introduction: Focused vs. Diffuse Learning


If we know how the brain works, we can learn more easily, with less frustration.

Human brains are complex
Researchers have found that we have two forms of thinking:
* Focused Mode
* Diffuse Mode

**Focused Mode**
Concentrate on something we try to understand.

**How it works?** When a though is introduced, is represented a familiar process (calculation of two numbers). This type of process, helps understand(solve) a problem related to our interest.



**Diffused Mode**
Relax thinking style, related to neuroresting states. This mode is more used when we want to learn something new(If we never have this thoughts before, the focused mode will block new ideas, that's the reason to change our way of thinking.).

When the thought takes of, we can look at things from a big picture perspective, the idea is to obtain the basics of the new thought not focusing in finniest aspects, just at least get to the initial place we need.
