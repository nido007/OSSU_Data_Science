## Learn How to Learn (Preparation Course)
## Week 1: What is Learning?
The ability to learn everyday is a gift, getting the right manual to learn will help up improve the way of thinking. This will reduce the frustration and increase the information learn.

Recommended book: a mind for numbers.

### Introduction: Focused vs.. Diffuse Learning


If we know how the brain works, we can learn more easily, with less frustration.

Human brains are complex
Researchers have found that we have two forms of thinking:
* Focused Mode
* Diffuse Mode

**Focused Mode**
Concentrate on something we try to understand.

**How it works?** When a though is introduced, is represented a familiar process (calculation of two numbers). This type of process, helps understand(solve) a problem related to our interest.



**Diffused Mode**
Relax thinking style, related to neuroresting states. This mode is more used when we want to learn something new(If we never have this thoughts before, the focused mode will block new ideas, that's the reason to change our way of thinking.).

When the thought takes of, we can look at things from a big picture perspective, the idea is to obtain the basics of the new thought not focusing in finniest aspects, just at least get to the initial place we need.

#### Using the Focused & Diffuse Modes(Or,a little Dalí Will Do You)

People who 

Salvador Dalí: 
* painter
* relaxed in a chair and let his mind go free
* then he apply the focused mode.

Thomas Edison
* Used the same techniques as Dalí.

The idea behind the idea is to do a little work everyday to hang thinking on.

Summary: 
* analogies provide powerful techniques for learning.
* we have two ways of thinking *focused* & *diffused mode*.
* Learn difficult things takes a considerable amount of time.

#### Week 1: What is Learning? Dr Terrence Sejnowski

We are not concisely awarded of how the brain works.

Influences in thinking are related to imaging techniques, 


synapses: connection between neurons

### Procrastination Memory & Sleep

#### A Procrastination Preview
*Insular cortex* stops negative stimulation by switching to other activities.

1. Unhappy Feeling
2. You funnel attention onto a more pleasant task
3. Feel happy (temporarily)

**Technique recommended:** A way to help is using a pomodoro, is a timer that often looks like a tomato. 
* set timer to 25 minutes
* no interruptions
* focus
* reward(websurfing, stretching, candy, etc...)

#### Practice makes Permanent
Gradually begin to figure out some tricks. 

Cow example.

For mathematical ideas there is no abstract equate to terms.
The more abstract the concept is, the more is needed to practice.

**Practice makes permanent:** The idea is to go down the path without looking at the solution, creating new patterns. This can be done by focusing on studying.

**Building strong neural structures:** the idea is to work a little bit on it every day.


#### Introduction to Memory
 
**Working Memory:** Part of memory due to what is immediately processing in the prefrontal cortex. Group memory items into chunks of memories, the idea is to try repeating concepts(try to work).  


**Long Term Memory:** This kind of memory is all over the brain, there can be so many memories on it. This memory type is important so 

New concepts enter onto working memory, if we want to add it to long term memory we should repeat it a lot of times.

**Technique recommended:** Space Repetition, it consist of repeating a certain vocabulary or information all over a week(repeat 20 times each day).

#### The importance of Sleep
When we are awake, the brain creates Poisson in a brain, sleeping removes this toxins.

Not sleeping creates:
* Diabetes
* Headaches
* Depression
* Heart disease

When we are sleep, the brain erases the less important aspects of learning renforcing the concepts tightening them up. This helps putting up neural solutions on concepts
